## Next Steps

1. **Apply all-new features SQL** — run `backend/sql/2026-05-15_all_new_features.sql` in Supabase
2. **Demo booking QA** — create rent/sale/shared-housing bookings in the browser, confirm them from `/booking/[id]`, verify dashboard tabs update, and confirm shared-housing renters appear as demo housemates on the listing page
3. **Wire homepage listings** — replace mock listings on `/` with Supabase query
4. **Testing** — AI unit tests, auth E2E tests
5. **Deployment** — Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend), GitHub Actions (CI)

## Locked Architecture Decisions

| Decision                                       | Reason                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Single `user` role (no broker)                 | All types, components, and API shapes depend on this |
| `owner_id` not `broker_id`                     | Consistent across DB, backend, and frontend          |
| Unified `/property/[id]` for all listing types | Shared housing redirects here                        |
| `/api/dashboard/me` single endpoint            | Dashboard mapper functions built around this shape   |
| `listing_status`: pending before active        | UI shows pending/rejected states                     |
| Local Ollama for AI                            | `axiom-llm:latest` — no external AI API calls        |
